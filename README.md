LA1K CW beacon project
======================

A 35-4400 MHz CW beacon design based on a PIC18 microcontroller, ADF4351 synthesizer and ADL5330 VGA (for smooth power ramping). Will initially be used for a 70 MHz beacon in Norway (with a 25 W PA and an external 10 MHz OCXO), and eventually replace hardware in our existing 2m and 70cm beacons.
