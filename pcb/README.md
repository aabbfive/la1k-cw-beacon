- BOM is located in this folder in CSV and tab-separated formats. 
- Most components have vendor part numbers from Digi-Key.
- Reference oscillator FOX924B, C40 and C38 is typically not inserted if used with external oscillator, as there will be some leakage over the REF_SEL header even without a jumper installed.
- For PCB 1.0, remember to scratch away solder stop mask for U1 and U2 exposed pads.
- Use standard 0.1" / 2.54 mm pitch break-away headers for PIC_GPIO, PIC_UART, REF_SEL and PIC_REF.
